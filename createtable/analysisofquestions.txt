1. Find the Ra & Dec of all objects with B > 16

SELECT Ra,Dec FROM MagTable WHERE B>16;

2. Output B, R, Teff and FeH for all stars (is this question well-defined?).

select m.B, m.R, p.Teff, p.FeH
from
	MagTable as m
	JOIN PhysTable as p
	ON m.Name = p.Name
Where m.Name IN ('VO-001','VO-002','VO-003','VO-004');

%Clearly VO-004 doesn't have any equivalent data in PhysTable and hence no row output for that.
	
3. Output the same for all objects with FeH > 0

select m.B, m.R, p.Teff, p.FeH
from
	MagTable as m
	JOIN PhysTable as p
	ON m.Name = p.Name
Where m.Name IN ('VO-001','VO-002','VO-003','VO-004') AND p.FeH>0;

4. Create a table with the B-R colour

SELECT Name, B, R, B-R as BR FROM MagTable
