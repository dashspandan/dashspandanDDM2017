1. When did we observe S2? 

select s.Star, o.Field, o.Date
from
	Stars as s
	JOIN Observations as o
	ON s.fieldID = o.ID
Where Star = 'S2'

2. Where is the FITS image stored for Star S5?

select s.Star, o.WhereStored
from
	Stars as s
	JOIN Observations as o
	ON s.fieldID = o.ID
Where Star = 'S5'

3. Give me a list of all stars observed on the same Field ID.

select o.ID, s.Star
	from Observations as o
	JOIN Stars as s
	On o.ID = s.fieldID
Where fieldID IN ('1','2','3')

% FieldID can be changed to the specific ID number required too.
